-- Works in any game where RespectFilteringEnabled option is false

-- !! If it doesn't say success, try it on a different game, usually an older game will work. !!

--[[ 

 A few games i've tested it on:

https://www.roblox.com/games/12109643/Fencing

https://www.roblox.com/games/189707/Natural-Disaster-Survival

https://www.roblox.com/games/192800/Work-at-a-Pizza-Place

https://www.roblox.com/games/6441847031/CHAOS

https://www.roblox.com/games/155615604/Prison-Life

Works on a lot more games than this, you just need to find them! ~ trial and error :)

	Notification.new("success", "Success", "Everyone can hear the sounds in this game!")	Notification.new("message", "YouTube : darkModz", "YouTube - darkmodz")

else

	Notification.new("warning", "Warning", "Unfortunately no one else can hear it in this game, try a different one.\nMaybe an older game will work.")

end

while wait() do

	for _, sound in next, workspace:GetDescendants() do

		if sound:IsA("Sound") then

			sound.Volume = 10

			sound:Play()

		end

	end
